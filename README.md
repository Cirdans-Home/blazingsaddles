# Iterative Methods For Large-Scale Saddle-Point Problems 

Codes for the course. The example run during the afternoon seminars are
collected here. 

This code depends on a number of auxiliary packages (FEM codes, solvers,
etc.) coming from acrosso the web, some of them are included as GitHub
submodules, others have to be downloaded. 

To obtain this material the first thing to do is cloning the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:Cirdans-Home/blazingsaddles.git
```
Then moving into the cloned folder and *initing* the submodules, that is
running
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
