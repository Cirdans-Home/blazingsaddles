# Notebooks

This folder contains the Notebooks as Git Submodules. They are indeed the GitHub Gists that are linked in the lecture notes. If you want to run them on your local machine you'll need some accomodation, specifically, installing the relevant Python libraries, and removing the specific needed to run them on Google Colab.

* For Python packages management a good idea is resorting to Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/
* FEniCSx/Dolfinx needs a bit more work to run locally, see: https://fenicsproject.org/ my suggestion is to use the Docker image and run Jupyter notebooks in that.
